### Project Overview

Flight pricing is dynamic and influenced by various factors—duration, stops, airline, time of booking, etc. This project challenges you to uncover trends in airfare and how different flight attributes impact pricing. Utilize your skills in EDA, SQL, and statistics to derive meaningful insights.

### Problem Statement

> "What drives flight fare variation in India?"
> 

Explore relationships between price and flight features like stops, airline, duration, route, and timings. Use insights to suggest how customers and airlines can make smarter decisions.
